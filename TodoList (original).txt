TODO LIST

x Implement Property.java code from forums
x Allow plugin to read existing LivingForest config files
x Add option to disable/enable sapling protection in the config
x Rewrite Hawox-AutoPlant's code to use internal bukkit scheduler
x Rewrite Hawox's code to use LinkedLists and Blockstates instead of Array and Block (May require jiggery to protect saplings)
x Implement Permissions, matching LF standard/creating own
x Stop tracking protection universally, just assign a non-repeating task to it and walk away.
x Separated task-related functions into a separate class
x 86 the start/stop task stuff and just use a loop similar to what you did for protection. right now you can't even have random
  or different times. Everything is pretty much just going to happen every 30 seconds!
x Remove redundant functions in RT class
x Organize the get/set functions in RealTree class and comment so it's easier to read
x Port over LF commands
x Check for creative mode, add toggle for it. (Disabled by default) (Check for server and then player gamemode)
x Strip config read/write into own separate class
x Write code to read/use LF's users.yml file

/ Create simple format for configuration options
/ Write console/commands with mind to how the LF commands are set up
/ Implement FastGrow (toggle)
/ Implement user.yml checks

* Give FG permissions
* Notify player when op has changed their RT settings
* Create RT-specific permissions
* Examine and verify functionality of over-growth feature, implement it 

* Implement non-permission user file (Basically, you're going to create a separate yml (or dat?) file to act
	as a "fake" BukkitPermissions plugin. It will act a little like the users.yml, except it will essentally
	track any player that joins (probably give this functionality back to users.yml) and assign them the 
	predefined RT Permissions. Then I'll just write another function for checking in Perms and be done with
	the whole damn thing.)


Future Version TODO LIST
* Add a debug mode with a bunch of output information.
* Implement ChopLog (toggle)
* Change start/stop task into a "feature" have it process all chopped trees randomly spawn saplings during the night cycle. Link into worldtime.
* Check to see if you've got more than a single log on the ground (probably check +5 above for any log) (Toggle)
* Implement feature to "regrow" missing sections of trees ruined by Enderman/players
* Allow 'natural' spread of forests over time.
* Add support for swamp trees to regrow (also maybe w/vines on them)
