TODO LIST

x Implement Property.java code from forums
x Allow plugin to read existing LivingForest config files
x Add option to disable/enable sapling protection in the config
x Rewrite Hawox-AutoPlant's code to use internal bukkit scheduler
x Rewrite Hawox's code to use LinkedLists and Blockstates instead of Array and Block (May require jiggery to protect saplings)
x Implement Permissions, matching LF standard/creating own
x Stop tracking protection universally, just assign a non-repeating task to it and walk away.
x Separated task-related functions into a separate class
x 86 the start/stop task stuff and just use a loop similar to what you did for protection. right now you can't even have random
  or different times. Everything is pretty much just going to happen every 30 seconds!
x Remove redundant functions in RT class
x Organize the get/set functions in RealTree class and comment so it's easier to read
x Port over LF commands
x Check for creative mode, add toggle for it. (Disabled by default) (Check for server and then player gamemode)
x Strip config read/write into own separate class
x Write code to read/use LF's users.yml file
x Examine and verify functionality of over-growth feature, implement it 
x Implement FastGrow (toggle)
x Implement user.yml checks
x Notify player when op has changed their RT settings
x Create simple format for configuration options
x Implement something like the users file

/ Write console/commands with mind to how the LF commands are set up
	* /realtree enable/disable 						- global on/off for plugin (make sure you safely kill your timers)
	- /realtree varchange <variable> <new value> 	- make sure you check for valid inputs
	- /realtree fastgrow 							- globally toggles named feature 
	- /realtree fastgrow <player/me>				- disable feature for specific player/self (permission based)
	- /realtree overgrow 							- globally toggles named feature 
	- /realtree overgrow <player/me>				- disable feature for specific player/self (permission based) 
	- /realtree replant (burn/chop) 				- globally toggles named feature
	- /realtree replant (burn/chop) <player/me>		- disable feature for specific player/self (permission based)
	* /realtree reload								- reload 

/ Create RT-specific permissions
	- realtree.toggle.plugin
	- realtree.toggle.self
	- realtree.toggle.all
	- realtree.config.reload
	- realtree.config.varichange
	
	These are for internal uses only
	- realtree.replant.chop
	- realtree.replant.burn
	- realtree.fastgrow
	- realtree.overgrow
		
/ Use FG permissions

* Error checking on config variables
* verify that auto/replant work on snow biomes

Future Version TODO LIST
* Add a debug mode with a bunch of output information.
* Implement ChopLog (toggle)
* Change start/stop task into a "feature" have it process all chopped trees randomly spawn saplings during the night cycle. Link into worldtime.
* Check to see if you've got more than a single log on the ground (probably check +5 above for any log) (Toggle)
* Implement feature to "regrow" missing sections of trees ruined by Enderman/players
* Allow 'natural' spread of forests over time.
* Add support for swamp trees to regrow (also maybe w/vines on them)
 
Known bugs
X Overgrow occasionally places saplings in locations where objects obstruct growing
X overgrow places saplings on top of long grass blocks
